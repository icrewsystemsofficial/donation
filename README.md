    <strong>#feedThePoor Initiative, 2020.</strong>
    <br>
    <small>"Feeding the hungry is greater work than raising the dead"</small>
</p>

## Why #feedThePoor?
<h3>"I don't know...I want to help, but who knows my money is actually being used to feed the needy?"</h3>
This, is the first thing that haunts the mind of every good soul that wants to help. "Trust & Transparency", This is the issue we're trying to fix with the help of technology. Seeing is beliving. With our app, the donor will be able to see the happy, smiley face of an underprivledged human whom they've just fed. "Trust & Transparency"

## How to setup & contribute?
1. ```git clone https://github.com/icrewsystemsofficial/donation.git```
2. cd into the directory
3. Run composer install, ```composer install```
4. Create a seperate branch for yourself in git. ```git branch BRANCHNAME``` & ```git checkout BRANCHNAME``` -- Interns are requested not to use Master branch at all. 
5. Copy .env file, ```cp .env.example .env```
6. Generate Key ```php artisan key:generate```
7. Go to phpMyAdmin (or any of your mysql consoles) and create a new database
8. Go to .env and update the value of your database name in the field "DB_DATABASE", for example: DB_DATABASE=feedthepoor
9. Run the command ```php artisan migrate```, this will create the tables (if any)
10. Run the command ```php artisan db:seed``` this will seed the database (if any seeders available)
11. Change the ```ADMIN_EMAIL``` parameter in the .env file to the administrator's email ID.

Done! Your project is now setup. You can now directly run it by going to your [http://localhost/donation](http://localhost/donation), you don't have to run ```php artisan serve``` command since we've changed the server.php to index.php to simulate a production environment.

##### You are requested to run ```composer install``` after each pull, since newer packages may be added while development
